Description: This package implements workalikes for the author's (and
    perhaps your) favorite features from other languages, making R
    programs shorter and more expressive. The centerpiece is an
    efficient facility for macro-like functions. Built on that are a
    destructuring-bind, a pipline macro similar to the "->" macro of
    Clojure, and other utilities.
