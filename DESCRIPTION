Description: This package implements workalikes for the author's (and
    perhaps your) favorite features from other languages, making R
    programs shorter and more expressive. Destructurimg bind lets you
    perform parallel assignments and unpack nested lists. A chain
    macro lets you quickly string several operations together, similar
    to Unix pipelines. A collection of functions makes it easy to work
    with `...` arguments and missing values. Behind the scenes is an
    efficient macro utility, with a much improved alternative to the
    bquote() function.
