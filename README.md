Look at your favorite language. Then at R. Then back to your 
favorite language. Then back to R, Sadly, R isn't your favorite 
language. But it could smell like your favorite language. Look 
down. Now back to R. Where are you? You're writing code in the 
language your language could smell like. Anything is possible. 
R's on a horse. 

This package implements workalikes for the author's (and
perhaps your) favorite features from other languages, making R
programs shorter and more expressive. The centerpiece is a highly
efficient facility for macro-like functions. Built on that are a
destructuring-bind, a pipline macro similar to the "->" macro of
Clojure, and [other utilities].
